### An ultra-simplified explanation  :thumbsup:

<i>Primarily written for my own benefit, but hopefully helpful to someone else as well. Here I try to make them stick in to your mind (and maybe mine) by explaining them in the simplest way possible. Contributions are always welcome.</i>

## Introduction
A programmer is just a tool that converts caffeine into code. A compiler is just a tool that converts code into machine language.

Wikipedia says:
> A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language)

This article will use [Power Fx](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-Fx) (open-source language written in C#) as a practical example of how compilers work and their common phases.
